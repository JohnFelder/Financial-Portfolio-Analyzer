The aim for our project is to simplify cryptocurrency investing through a portfolio analyzer. Weâ€™ll examine five different cryptocurrencies past and futures through analyzing various models and ratios dictating each individual cryptos metrics, measuring future performance, along with comparing them amongst each other to dictate the best investment options. The cryptos analyzed in this project include the following: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Binance, and Litecoin.
